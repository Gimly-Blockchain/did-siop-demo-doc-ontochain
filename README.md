## Summary

This demo shows an authentication flow using the [DIDSIOP library](#did-auth-siop). The underlying technology allows a
user to authenticate to a provider by scanning a QR code that is presented on by the relying party (RP). For this demo
project, the [Demo WEB](#onto-web-demo) app is the relying party (RP) and the [Demo RN](#demo-rn) is the the OpenID
provider (OP). The flow starts with the RP where the user clicks a login button on the web page, after which a QR code
is generated. The user scans the QR code using the Demo RN app, which in turn requests access to the protected resources
hosted by the RP. Since the user is not logged in, an authentication request will be sent back to the OP. If the request
is valid, the OP sends an authentication response back to the RP, which verifies the validity of response. If all steps
succeed, access to the protected resources is granted to the user. The user will now be redirected on the web app to
view the protected resource. [GimlyID-QR-Code](#gimlyid-qr-code) and [GimlyID-QR-Code-Scanner](#gimlyid-qr-code-scanner)
are employed to respectively generate and read the QR code used in the authentication process.

## Setup

## Demo WEB

#### Configure environment
In the onto-demo-server folder, create a files called .env.local and populate it using .env as example.
A valid config will look like this
```dotenv
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5001
COOKIE_SIGNING_KEY=8E5er6YyAO6dIrDTm7BXYWsafBSLxzjb
REDIRECT_URL_BASE=http://192.168.1.200:5001/ext
RP_DID=did:ethr:0xe1dB95357A4258b33A994Fa8cBA5FdC6bd70011D
RP_PRIVATE_HEX_KEY=850e54b92c6291a1ff7b8c3ef30e032571ed77c9e5c78b1cd6ee5fec4fea984f
AUTH_REQUEST_EXPIRES_AFTER_SEC=300
MOCK_AUTH_RESPONSE=false
```
(Exception for the IP address this is a valid configuration to test with.)

#### Build & start
From the root directory
- yarn global add concurrently
- yarn global add ts-node

## GimlyID QR Code
This is the QR code generator, it works with React and React-Native. It generates a QR code containing:

| prop                    | type                         | default value | description                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Demo RN
This is the React-Native application (OP) that stores the self issued credentials
-> Needs input from Sander

Reference: [Demo-RN](https://github.com/Sphereon/rn-did-siop-example-app)

## DID Auth Siop
SIOP v2 (REFRENCE) is an extension of OpenID Connect (REFRENCE) to allow End-users to act as OpenID Providers (OPs)
themselves. Using Self-Issued OPs, End-users can authenticate themselves and present claims directly to the Relying
Parties (RPs), typically a webapp, without relying on a third-party Identity Provider. This makes the solution fully
self sovereign, as it does not rely on any third parties and strictly happens peer 2 peer, but still uses the OpenID
Connect protocol. Next to the user acting as an OpenID Provider, this library also includes support for Verifiable
Presentations (REFRENCE) using the Presentation Exchange (REFRENCE to DIF) support provided by Sphereon's pe-js library
(REFRENCE). This means that the Relying Party can pose submission requirements on the Verifiable Credentials it would
like to receive from the client/OP. The OP then checks whether it has the credentials to support the submission
requirements. Only if that is the case it will send the relevant (parts of the) credentials as a Verifiable Presentation
in the Authentication Response destined for the Webapp/Relying Party. The relying party in turn checks validity of the
Verifiable Presentation(s) as well as the match with the submission requirements. Only if everything is verified
successfully the RP serves the protected page(s). This means that the authentication can be extended with claims about
the authenticating entity, but it can also be used to easily consume credentials from supporting applications, without
having to setup DIDComm (REFRENCE) connections for instance. The term Self-Issued comes from the fact that the End-users
(OP) issue self-signed ID Tokens to prove validity of the identifiers and claims. This is a trust model different from
that of the rest of OpenID Connect where OP is run by the third party who issues ID Tokens on behalf of the End-user to
the Relying Party upon the End-user's consent. This means the End-User is in control about his/her data instead of the
3rd party OP.

# Steps involved

Flow diagram:

![Flow diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sphereon-Opensource/did-auth-siop/develop/docs/auth-flow-diagram.txt)


1. Client (OP) initiates an Auth request by POST-ing to an endpoint, like for instance `/did-siop/v1/authentications` or clicking a Login button and scanning a QR code
2. Web (RP) receives the request and access the RP object which creates the authentication request as JWT, signs it and returns the response as an OpenID Connect URI
    1. JWT example:
    ```json
    // JWT Header
    {
      "alg": "ES256K",
      "kid": "did:ethr:0xcBe71d18b5F1259faA9fEE8f9a5FAbe2372BE8c9#controller",
      "typ": "JWT"
    }
     
    // JWT Payload
   {
      "iat": 1632336634,
      "exp": 1632337234,
      "response_type": "id_token",
      "scope": "openid",
      "client_id": "did:ethr:0xcBe71d18b5F1259faA9fEE8f9a5FAbe2372BE8c9",
      "redirect_uri": "https://acme.com/siop/v1/sessions",
      "iss": "did:ethr:0xcBe71d18b5F1259faA9fEE8f9a5FAbe2372BE8c9",
      "response_mode": "post",
      "nonce": "qBrR7mqnY3Qr49dAZycPF8FzgE83m6H0c2l0bzP4xSg",
      "state": "b32f0087fc9816eb813fd11f",
      "registration": {
         "did_methods_supported": [
          "did:ethr:",
          "did:eosio:"
         ],
         "subject_identifiers_supported": "did"
      }
   }
    ```

    2. The Signed JWT, called the JWS follows the following scheme (JWS Compact Serialization, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-7.1):

   `BASE64URL(UTF8(JWT Protected Header)) || '.' ||
   BASE64URL(JWT Payload) || '.' ||
   BASE64URL(JWS Signature)`

    3. Create the URI containing the JWS:
   ```
   openid://?response_type=id_token 
      &scope=openid
      &client_id=did%3Aethr%3A0xBC9484414c1DcA4Aa85BadBBd8a36E3973934444
      &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Frp.acme.com%2Fsiop%2Fjwts
      &iss=did%3Aethr%3A0xBC9484414c1DcA4Aa85BadBBd8a36E3973934444
      &response_mode=post
      &nonce=qBrR7mqnY3Qr49dAZycPF8FzgE83m6H0c2l0bzP4xSg&state=b32f0087fc9816eb813fd11f
      &registration=%5Bobject%20Object%5D
      &request=<JWS here>
   ```
3. Web receives the Auth Request URI Object from RP
4. Web sends the Auth Request URI in the response body to the client
5. Client accesses OP object to create an Authentication response
6. OP verifies the authentication request, including checks on whether the RP did and keytypes are supported, next to whether the OP can satisfy the RPs requested Verifiable Credentials
7. OP creates the authentication response object as follows:
    1. Create an ID token as shown below:

    ````json
    // JWT encoded ID Token
    // JWT Header
    {
      "alg": "ES256K",
      "kid": "did:ethr:0x998D43DA5d9d78500898346baf2d9B1E39Eb0Dda#keys-1",
      "typ": "JWT",
    }
    // JWT Payload
   {
      "iat": 1632343857.084,
      "exp": 1632344857.084,
      "iss": "https://self-issued.me/v2",
      "sub": "did:ethr:0x998D43DA5d9d78500898346baf2d9B1E39Eb0Dda",
      "aud": "https://acme.com/siop/v1/sessions",
      "did": "did:ethr:0x998D43DA5d9d78500898346baf2d9B1E39Eb0Dda",
      "sub_type": "did",
      "sub_jwk": {
         "kid": "did:ethr:0x998D43DA5d9d78500898346baf2d9B1E39Eb0Dda#key-1",
         "kty": "EC",
         "crv": "secp256k1",
         "x": "a4IvJILPHe3ddGPi9qvAyXY9qMTEHvQw5DpQYOJVA0c",
         "y": "IKOy0JfBF8FOlsOJaC41xiKuGc2-_iqTI01jWHYIyJU"
      },
      "nonce": "qBrR7mqnY3Qr49dAZycPF8FzgE83m6H0c2l0bzP4xSg",
      "state": "b32f0087fc9816eb813fd11f",
      "registration": {
         "issuer": "https://self-issued.me/v2",
         "response_types_supported": "id_token",
         "authorization_endpoint": "openid:",
         "scopes_supported": "openid",
         "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
            "ES256K",
            "EdDSA"
         ],
         "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": [
            "ES256K",
            "EdDSA"
         ],
         "subject_types_supported": "pairwise"
      }
   }
    ````

    2. Sign the ID token using the DID key (kid) using JWS scheme (JWS Compact Serialization, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-7.1) and send it to the RP:

   `BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header)) || '.' ||
   BASE64URL(JWS Payload) || '.' ||
   BASE64URL(JWS Signature)`

8. OP returns the Auth response and jwt object to the client
9. Client does an HTTP POST to redirect_uri from the request (and the aud in the response): https://acme.com/siop/v1/sessions using "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
10. Web receives the ID token (auth response) and uses the RP's object verify method
11. RP performs the validation of the token, including signature validation, expiration and Verifiable Presentations if any. It returns the Verified Auth Response to WEB
12. WEB returns a 200 response to Client with a redirect to another page (logged in or confirmation of VP receipt etc).
13. From that moment on Client can use the Auth Response as bearer token as long as it is valid

### Relying Party (RP)

expect(verifiedAuthResponseWithJWT.payload.nonce).toMatch("qBrR7mqnY3Qr49dAZycPF8FzgE83m6H0c2l0bzP4xSg");
````
## DID resolution
### Description
Resolves the DID to a DID document using the DID method provided in didUrl and using DIFs [did-resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver) and Sphereons [Universal registrar and resolver client](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/did-uni-client).
This process allows retrieving public keys and verificationMethod material, as well as services provided by a DID controller. Can be used in both the webapp and mobile applications. Uses the did-uni-client, but could use other DIF did-resolver drivers as well. The benefit of the uni client is that it can resolve many DID methods. Since the resolution itself is provided by the mentioned external dependencies above, we suffice with a usage example.
#### Usage
```typescript
import { Resolver } from 'did-resolver'
import { getResolver as getUniResolver } from '@sphereon/did-uni-client'

const resolver = new Resolver(getUniResolver('ethr'));

resolver.resolve('did:ethr:0x998D43DA5d9d78500898346baf2d9B1E39Eb0Dda').then(doc => console.log)
```

## JWT and DID creation and verification
Please note that this chapter is about low level JWT functions, which normally aren't used by end users of this library. Typically, you use the AuthenticationRequest and Response classes (low-level) or the OP and RP classes (high-level).

### Create JWT
Creates a signed JWT given a DID which becomes the issuer, a signer function, and a payload over which the signature is created.

#### Usage
````typescript
const signer = ES256KSigner(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);
createDidJWT({requested: ['name', 'phone']}, {issuer: 'did:eosio:example', signer}).then(jwt => console.log)
````
### Verify JWT
Verifies the given JWT. If the JWT is valid, the promise returns an object including the JWT, the payload of the JWT, and the DID Document of the issuer of the JWT, using the resolver mentioned earlier. The checks performed include, general JWT decoding, DID resolution, Proof purposes
proof purposes allows restriction of verification methods to the ones specifically listed, otherwise the 'authentication' verification method of the resolved DID document will be used
#### Usage
```typescript
verifyDidJWT(jwt, resolver, {audience: '6B2bRWU3F7j3REx3vkJ..'}).then(verifiedJWT => {
       const did = verifiedJWT.issuer;                          // DID of signer
       const payload = verifiedJWT.payload;                     // The JHT payload
       const doc = verifiedJWT.didResolutionResult.didDocument; // DID Document of signer
       const jwt = verifiedJWT.jwt;                             // JWS in string format 
       const signerKeyId = verifiedJWT.signer.id;               // ID of key in DID document that signed JWT
       ...
   });
```

## AuthenticationRequest class

### createURI
Create a signed URL encoded URI with a signed SIOP Authentication request

#### Usage
```typescript
const EXAMPLE_REDIRECT_URL = "https://acme.com/hello";
const EXAMPLE_REFERENCE_URL = "https://rp.acme.com/siop/jwts";
const HEX_KEY = "f857544a9d1097e242ff0b287a7e6e90f19cf973efe2317f2a4678739664420f";
const DID = "did:ethr:0x0106a2e985b1E1De9B5ddb4aF6dC9e928F4e99D0";
const KID = "did:ethr:0x0106a2e985b1E1De9B5ddb4aF6dC9e928F4e99D0#keys-1";

const opts = {
   redirectUri: EXAMPLE_REDIRECT_URL,
   requestBy: {
      type: SIOP.PassBy.VALUE,
   },
   signatureType: {
      hexPrivateKey: HEX_KEY,
      did: DID,
      kid: KID,
   },
   registration: {
      didMethodsSupported: ['did:ethr:'],
      subjectIdentifiersSupported: SubjectIdentifierType.DID,
      registrationBy: {
         type: SIOP.PassBy.VALUE,
      },
   }
};

AuthenticationRequest.createURI(opts)
    .then(uri => console.log(uri.encodedUri));

         didMethods: ["ethr"]
      }
   },
}
const jwt = 'ey..........' // JWT created by RP
AuthenticationRequest.verifyJWT(jwt).then(req => {
   console.log(`issuer: ${req.issuer}`);
   console.log(JSON.stringify(req.signer));
});
// issuer: "did:ethr:0x56C4b92D4a6083Fcee825893A29023cDdfff5c66"
// "signer": {
//      "id": "did:ethr:0x56C4b92D4a6083Fcee825893A29023cDdfff5c66#controller",
